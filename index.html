        <h1>Hello, I’m Shashank! 👋🏻</h1>
        <p>
            I design, code, and market the products I build. I love
            solo-travelling and meeting people from different walks of life. At
            some point in life my ambition was to build a billion dollar
            company. Today, I want to build a life that allows me to work from
            anywhere I want, with people I enjoy working with.
        </p>
        <p>
            As for career - I started my first startup in college and scaled it
            up to $50K at 18. I have 7+ years of experience as a full-stack
            engineer, EM & TPM across multiple startups (mostly B2B SaaS). I
            have run a dev shop for 3 years shipping 16 products; leading a team
            of 6-8 engineers. I worked closely with the CXOs of Swiggy, Zerodha
            & MPL helping them build internal tech.
