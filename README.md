## Hello, I’m Shashank! 👋🏻

I design, code, and market the products I build. Semi-Nomad. Love meeting people from different walks of life. Early 20s ambition was to build a billion dollar company. Today, I am building a life
that allows me to work on anything I enjoy, from anywhere I want, alongside people I enjoy working with.

Career wise: I started my first startup in college and scaled it
up to $50K. 7+ years of experience as a full-stack
engineer, EM & TPM across multiple startups (mostly B2B SaaS). Have run a dev shop for 3+ years shipping 16 products; lead a team of 6-8 engineers. Prev built tech at [Swiggy](https://swiggy.com), [TrueBeacon](https://truebeacon.com) (by [Zerodha](https://zerodha.com)), [MPL](https://mpl.live), [Fyle](https://fylehq.com) & Belong.
