## Hello, I’m Shashank! 👋🏻

I design, code, and market the products I build. I love solo-travelling and meeting people from different walks of life. At some point in life my ambition was to build a billion dollar company. Today, I want to build a life that allows me to work from anywhere I want, with people I enjoy working with.

As for career - I started my first startup in college and scaled it up to $50K at 18. I have 7+ years of experience as a full-stack engineer, EM & TPM across multiple startups (mostly B2B SaaS). I have run a dev shop for 3 years shipping 16 products; leading a team of 6-8 engineers. I worked closely with the CXOs of Swiggy, Zerodha & MPL helping them build internal tech.
