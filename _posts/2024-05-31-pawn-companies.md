## PAWN (Profitable, Automated, Well-Run, Nimble) Companies

When I was in my early 20s, my ambition was to build a billion-dollar company. Today, my goal is different. I want to build a life that allows me to work on anything I enjoy, from anywhere I want, alongside people I enjoy working with. I like to call these PAWN companies: Profitable, Automated, Well-Run, and Nimble.

*Profitable*: This isn't about getting rich quickly or relying on external funding. It's about building a business with a sustainable revenue model, one that generates healthy profit margins consistently. A profitable business means financial independence. It means not having to answer to investors or chase the next round of funding. It means being in control of your own destiny.

*Automated*: A PAWN company leverages technology, particularly AI, to drive efficiency. This means setting up self-sufficient systems that require minimal updates or constant management. Automation is about working smarter, not harder. It's about reducing the need for a large workforce and cutting down the time required to get things done. Imagine running a company that only needs a few hours of work per week after the initial setup.

*Well-Run*: This means employing effective management practices that streamline operations and reduce inefficiencies. It's about creating incentives that work well both short-term and long-term for everyone working on it. Effectively, designing operations so they can be managed by a small team or even a single person. After shipping, a PAWN company shouldn't need more than 20 hours of work per week to keep things running smoothly.

*Nimble*: Finally, a PAWN company is nimble. It avoids the bloat of excessive people, processes, and tools. Lean operations are key. This means staying adaptable and ready to pivot when necessary, without the burden of cumbersome processes or bureaucracy. Nimbleness is about maintaining the ability to quickly respond to changes and opportunities.

PAWN companies are best suited for single person businesses but can be easily adopted by most bootstrapped companies. They're designed to offer financial success, personal fulfillment, and operational efficiency. They prioritize automation and minimal management, creating an environment where founders and a small team can thrive with minimal chaos.

So, if you're looking to build a company that allows you to work on what you love, from anywhere you want, alongside people you enjoy, consider the PAWN model. It's not just about building a business; it's about building a life.
