# 🤝 Shashank Jha: Fractional CTO

## 👋 Hey, I’m Shashank [LI](https://linkedin.com/in/theshajha/) | [Tw](https://twitter.com/theshajha)

I’m an experienced engineering leader. Prev built tech for [Swiggy](https://swiggy.com), [TrueBeacon](https://truebeacon.com) (by [Zerodha](https://zerodha.com)), [MPL](https://mpl.live), [Fyle](https://fylehq.com) & Belong. I founded [Tiny API](https://tinyapi.co) (part of [Antler India Residency](https://www.antler.co/)) which was voted #1 product of the day on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/products/tiny-api#tiny-api).

I was on a break for last few weeks (after 8 long years). I am back to building. This time helping startups win as a fractional CTO.

I handle everything from technical strategy and managing engineers to design, product support, and delivering great products. My aim is to get the job done quickly and well, so your company can succeed.

Success for me means hearing you say, "Relax, Shashank's on it"

#### Why fractional CTO?
I love building and have built and shipped several products since I was 16. I have worked closely with 40+ founders and teams in the past as an engineer or engineering leader to move the needle. I have built businesses and products as a solo founder. I understand the nature of early-stage companies and have learnt to navigate it.
